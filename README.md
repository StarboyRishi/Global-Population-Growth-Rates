# Global-Population-Growth-Rates

**Overview**

This repository contains an analysis of global population growth rates by city for the year 2024. The dataset provides insights into the population growth trends in various cities around the world. The analysis includes data visualization and statistical exploration to uncover patterns and trends in population growth.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following columns:

**City:** The name of the city.

**Country:** The country in which the city is located.

**Continent:** The continent where the city is situated.

**Population (2024):** Projected population of the city for the year 2024.

**Population (2023):** Recorded population of the city for the year 2023.

**Growth Rate:** The annual growth rate of the city's population.

**Objectives**

**Analyze Population Growth:**
1.Examine the population growth rate for cities worldwide.
2.Identify trends and patterns in population changes from 2023 to 2024.

**Data Visualization:**
1.Create visualizations to illustrate population growth trends.
2.Use scatter plots, bar plots, and other relevant charts to present findings.

**Geographical Insights:**
1.Map population growth rates on a global map to visualize geographic patterns.

**Analysis**
**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
**Missing Values:** Handled missing values in the dataset.

**Data Types:** Ensured that all columns have the appropriate data types for analysis.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Summary Statistics:** Calculated summary statistics to understand the distribution of population growth rates.

**Top Cities:** Identified the top cities with the highest and lowest growth rates.

**3. Data Visualization**

**Bar Plot:** Visualized the top 10 cities with the highest population growth rates.

**Scatter Plot:** Compared population growth rates between 2023 and 2024.

**Geographical Map:** Plotted the population growth rates on a global map to identify regional trends.
